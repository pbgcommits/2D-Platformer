# Welcome to ShadowMario!

This is a small 2D platformer I made for my object-oriented subject at The University of Melbourne.

## Installation/execution:
Install with git clone or by downloading a zip file.
The easiest way to run it is by opening and running the project directory in IntelliJ IDEA.
